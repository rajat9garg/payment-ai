## Completed Work
### 2025-05-31
- **Payment API Idempotency** - Status: Completed
  - **Details:**
    - Added Idempotency-Key header to OpenAPI specification
    - Updated controller to accept idempotency key header
    - Implemented Redis distributed locking mechanism
    - Added version column to transactions table
    - Updated repository to handle optimistic and pessimistic locking
    - Fixed jOOQ compilation issues with VERSION field
    - Created comprehensive unit tests
  - **Impact:**
    - Ensures payment requests are processed exactly once
    - Prevents duplicate payments in concurrent scenarios
    - Allows clients to safely retry failed requests
    - Improves system reliability and data consistency
    - Enables horizontal scaling with consistent behavior

- **Redis Integration** - Status: Completed
  - **Details:**
    - Fixed Redis dependency conflicts by using Spring Boot starter
    - Implemented Redis configuration with proper connection factory
    - Created test configuration with mocked Redis
    - Added idempotency key service for payment processing
    - Configured test environment with H2 database
  - **Impact:**
    - Enabled Redis-based distributed locking for idempotency
    - Improved test reliability with mocked dependencies
    - Established patterns for testing with external services
    - Maintained clean separation between test and production configurations

- **Payment Modes API** - Status: Completed
  - **Details:**
    - Created database tables: `payment_modes` and `payment_types`
    - Implemented repository layer with jOOQ
    - Created service layer with business logic
    - Implemented REST controller following OpenAPI-first approach
    - Added comprehensive test coverage
  - **Impact:**
    - Enabled retrieval of available payment modes and types
    - Established patterns for future API development
    - Ensured type safety with jOOQ
    - Maintained clean separation of concerns

### Technical Decisions:
- **Idempotency Implementation:** Client-provided UUID keys in HTTP headers
- **Concurrency Control:** Redis distributed locks + database optimistic locking
- **OpenAPI-First Approach:** All APIs are defined in OpenAPI spec first
- **jOOQ for Database Access:** For type-safe SQL queries
- **Flyway for Migrations:** For database versioning and consistency
- **Kotlin Coroutines:** For non-blocking operations
- **JUnit 5 & MockK:** For comprehensive testing

## Risks & Mitigations
### Redis Lock Expiration
- **Risk:** Long-running payment processing could exceed lock timeout
- **Impact:** Medium (Potential duplicate payments in rare cases)
- **Mitigation:** Implemented database-level constraints as backup
- **Status:** Monitoring

### Database Concurrency
- **Risk:** High volume could lead to lock contention
- **Impact:** Medium (Potential performance degradation)
- **Mitigation:** Implemented optimistic locking with retry mechanism
- **Status:** Monitoring

### jOOQ Generated Classes
- **Risk:** Missing VERSION field requires manual handling
- **Impact:** Low (Workaround implemented)
- **Mitigation:** Scheduled regeneration of jOOQ classes
- **Status:** Planned for 2025-06-01
